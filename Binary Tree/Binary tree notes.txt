TREE:
	BINARY TREE:
		Every node as utmost 2 nodes.
		Every node has a left and right node
		Every node's left child is considered 1st child and right child as 2n child.
	PROPER BINARY TREE:
		Every Node as either 0 or 2 child.
	FULL BINARY TREE:
		Every Internal node as exactly 2 children
		All leaf nodes are at the same level
		Number of nodes = 2^h - 1 nodes, where h = height of the tree.
	COMPLETE BINARY TREE: USED IN HEAP DATA STRUCTURE.
		Binary tree where nodes at each level are numbered from left to right without gap.
	
	WAYS TO TRAVERSE IN TREE:
		1. Inorder Traverse: Left Node => Root => Right Node. (A+B)
		2. Preorder Traverse: Root => Left recursively => Right recursively. (+AB)
		3. Postorder Traverse: Left recursively => Right recursively => Root. (AB+)
		4. Level order Traverse: Visit nodes level by level from top to bottom => Within level visit node left to right.

BINARY SEARCH TREE:
	Node in left subtree should be smaller than Parent node and
	Node in right subtree should be greater than Parent node.

	Example:
				5
		3				8
	1		4				9


WHY BALANCED SEARCH TREES:
	1. Reduces the height of the Binary Search Tree after insertion, deleteion etc. So as to have better performance
	2. Roatation and restructuring. => Reducing the height of th tree
	3. Modifies the relationship between Parent - Child
	4. BALANCED SEARCH TREES : AVL, Red Black, Splay Trees
	5. Balance factor OR Height Balance Property: Height of the left subtree and the right subtree is atmost 1
	6. AVL Tree: Any Binary Serach tree that satisifies Height Balance Property.
		


AVL: 
	Any Binary Serach tree that satisifies Height Balance Property.

Disadvantages of AVL:
	1. They may require additional restructuring opertaions or rotations after insertion or deleteion.
	2. Less effecient compared to Red-Black.
	
Red-Black:
	It is a Binary Search tree having
	Every node as colored either Red or Black and satisfies the following properties.
	1. Root Property: The Root of the binary search tree is always Black.
	2. Red Property: We cannot have 2 consecutive Red Nodes in any path.
	3. Depth property: Each path from root node to leaf node will have same number of black nodes.
	
	Whenever a new node is added, it is given a red color.
	So recoloring is required.
